Term: Google Ads Ad Network Type (Search vs Partner Search)
Category: Dimensions - Campaign
Definition: These are dimensional attribute values that indicate whether a campaign is running on Search, Partner Search, or Content Ad Network Types.
How to determine: This can be determined from the segments_ad_network_type column in the DE_INGRESS.GOOGLE_ADS.CAMPAIGN_PERFORMANCE_DAILY table.  
    If the value is "Search" it is "Search" network type.  If the value is "Search Partners" it is "Partner Search" network type.  If the value is "Content" it is "Content" network type.
Notes: The term Google Search Network could be ambiguous since it might refer to all search traffic from Google Ads whether it is "Google Search" or "Google Search Partners".  
    If the context only refers to GSN, then assume its all Google Ads search traffic and if it is comparing Google Search network to Search Partner network then assume its "Search" or "Partner Search".
    Do not use UTM Source to disambiguate.  UTM Source is not a reliable indicator of the network type.
    If the the term used is "Google Search RSoC Online" or semantically similar then that is referring to the RSoC sellside only and no buyside filtering should be applied.
    If you cannot disambiguate the context with the above heuristics with > 90% confidence, then return a comment that states "Cannot disambiguate Google Search Network context."

Term: RSoC (Related Search on Content)
Category: Dimension (Monetization Product)
Definition: A specific type of sell-side monetization product.
How to identify (these are all weak heuristics):  
    If there are any segments containing "rsoc" or "google" then it is a RSoC product.
    If there are any segments where widget_loads > 0 then it is a RSoC product. 
    If any of the conditions above are true then it is a RSoC product. i.e. (SEGMENT ILIKE '%rsoc%' OR SEGMENT ILIKE '%google%') OR WIDGET_LOADS > 0
    If net_revenue = gross_revenue then it is a RSoC Online product but this is only sufficient to disambiguate from RSoC Direct.  The above heuristics are still required to narrow down to RSoC.
